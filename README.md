Distributed high availability failover, written in cross-platform C# [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet) (Linux, Windows and macOS supported).

You can [join](https://t.me/dhaf_chat) a Telegram chat to discuss **dhaf**.

# Why is it useful? üöÄ
Dhaf is a system that keeps your web service **always online** for the end user. It's available to everyone for free and without the need for special knowledge or complicated network infrastructure.

Dhaf has switchers - various providers to manage entry points of web-service, health checkers and notifiers.
It is extremely flexible, extensible and easy to use and configure.

To avoid bogging you down with details right away, let's take a look at one of the great use cases below.

One of the switchers implemented in Dhaf is the Cloudflare provider. This company [guarantees](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) the following for **free**:
> Our authoritative DNS is the fastest in the world, offering DNS lookup speed of 11ms on average and worldwide DNS propagation in less than 5 seconds.

Thus, this mechanism can be used to avoid a single point of failure ([SPoF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)) of your network service (website, etc.). This is completely legal and in accordance with Cloudflare rules (using their official API).
Also a bonus are important security features: protection from DDoS and hiding the real IP of your servers.

# Who is it suitable for?
This solution is perfect for small and medium-sized projects that are not ready to spend huge resources (including financial) to maintain high availability of their services. If you want to provide HA fast and simple then this solution is for you.

# What major features does dhaf have?
- Failover (dhaf will automatically and transparently switch your servers to end clients if necessary);
- Switchover (manually switching your servers) ‚Äî useful for debugging and performing server maintenance invisibly to the end client;
- Support for several different services in one dhaf cluster (which may "located" in subdomains of your domain name, for example);
- Flexible notifier providers. Notifications are already available for:
    - Email
    - Telegram Messenger
- Flexible customization of the health checks of your service;
- All user configuration in YAML format;
- Only you decide from where to check the availability of your services;
- User-friendly CLI for check and manage your dhaf cluster;
- REST API for check and manage your dhaf cluster;
- Feature to easily create your own providers for switchers, health checkers and notifiers in C#;
- Feature to connect own executable scripts (e.g., in Python) as switchers and health checkers;
- High availability and distribution due to the fact that dhaf is a cluster.

# Prerequisites
The following is recommended for stable operation of this solution:
1. Two servers of your entry point (primary, secondary) in independent data centers. This can be both load balancers (such as haproxy) and directly your services;
2. Three dhaf servers in independent datacenters. These can be the **cheapest** virtual servers (including cloud servers), because the load on them is minimal. The following should be installed on them:
    - **dhaf** (current project);
    - **[etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd)** >= v3.5 as DCS (Distributed Configuration Store);
    -  .NET Runtime >= 5.0 (download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime)).

# Quick Start
Below is a simple example of how to make dhaf work (with Cloudflare provider as switcher).
1. Suppose you have two similar servers in different data centers, which both provide your web-service:
    |Name|IP|Priority|
    | :-: | :-: | :-: |
    |serv1|111.111.111.11|1|
    |serv2|222.222.222.22|2|
2. Let us also assume that you have prepared three dhaf servers in different datacenters:
    |Name|IP|
    | :-: | :-: |
    |d1|111.1.1.1|
    |d2|112.2.2.2|
    |d3|113.3.3.3|
3. Install and start etcd on all the dhaf servers (if you have not already done so). See details [here](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/quickstart/) and [here](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/clustering/).
4. Download and install our [dhaf builds](https://github.com/hyperion-cs/dhaf/releases) or build from sources (requires .NET >= 5.0) on all the dhaf servers;
5. Create a Cloudflare account with a free plan (this will be enough). Transfer there DNS management for your domain name `foo.com`. Also note that your domain name must have only one A record in the DNS that has the Clouflare proxying checkbox checked. Otherwise, you will get [round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS) detrimental for our purposes and/or unacceptably slow updating of DNS records for end clients;
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning! To combat scammers, Cloudflare does not allow DNS configuration via the official API for domains with a .cf, .ga, .gq, .ml, or .tk TLD (top-level domain). Thus, it is not possible to work with them in **dhaf** either. However, it is still possible to manually configure them in Cloudflare Dashboard.
6. Using the Clouflare dashboard, [create](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) an API token (if you have not already done so) with access to edit the DNS records of your domain zone. You also need to set an adequate TTL (lifetime) of your token, and keep it up to date.
7. For the **first** dhaf node, —Åreate a configuration file `config-n1.dhaf`, which has the following contents:
```yaml
dhaf:
  cluster-name: first-dhaf-cluster
  node-name: node-1

etcd:
  hosts: http://111.1.1.1:2379,http://112.2.2.2:2379,http://113.3.3.3:2379

services:
  - name: main
    domain: foo.com
    entry-points:
      - name: ep-1
        ip: 111.111.111.11
      - name: ep-2
        ip: 222.222.222.22
    switcher:
      type: cloudflare
      api-token: <your_api_token>
      zone: foo.com
    health-checker:
      type: web
      schema: http
```
8. As you can see from the value of the `dhaf.node-name` parameter of the configuration file above, it is intended for the first dhaf node. Create two more of these, replacing the value of the parameter `dhaf.node-name` with `node-2` and `node-3` respectively (as well as the name of the config so as not to get confused);
9. The only thing left to do is to run dhaf on all dhaf servers (don't forget to substitute the appropriate configuration file):
```shell
./dhaf.node --config config-n1.dhaf
```
10. After the dhaf cluster is fully initialized, you can see its status via CLI:
```shell
./dhaf.cli status-services --config config-n1.dhaf
```
11. Congratulations! Everything works. And now you can test failures of your servers as an experiment.

# What are the benefits of dhaf being a cluster?
Well, such as these:
- If one of the dhaf cluster nodes fails, the cluster itself will still continue to work (as long as possible). If the leader fails, a so-called race for the leader will immediately [begin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_election), i.e. a new leader will be determined by the "first come, first served" method;
- Health checks for the web service are performed by all available nodes, and the decision about (un)availability of it is collective. And only if the majority considers that the service is unavailable, the cluster leader starts the procedure to switch the entry point to the web service (in the case of Cloudflare's switcher provider, it changes the A-record in Cloudflare DNS to the next server). This elegantly solves the problem when one of the nodes has decided that the web service is unreachable, although in fact it is not true for real users.

# Available CLI commands:
- `./dhaf.cli status-dhaf --config <config_file>` - show dhaf cluster status information.
- `./dhaf.cli status-service --service <service_name> --config <config_file>` - show service status information.
- `./dhaf.cli status-service --config <config_file>` - show all services status information.
- `./dhaf.cli switchover-candidates --service <service_name> --config <config_file>` - show suitable entry points for switchover.
- `./dhaf.cli switchover-to <ep> --service <service_name> --config <config_file>` - switchover to the `<ep>` entry point.
- `./dhaf.cli switchover-purge --config <config_file>` - purge the switchover requirement.
- `./dhaf.cli node-decommission <node_name> -config <config_file>` - decommission the dhaf node `<node_name>`.
- `./dhaf.cli help` - display more information on a specific command.
- `./dhaf.cli version` - display version information.

# Available REST API endpoints:

Telegram bot prerequisites:
- All you have to do is create a bot via @BotFather (more details [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot)) and write the API key in the config. Everything else is taken care of by the `tg` provider (in other words, the `tg` provider acts as a server for the bot). It does NOT require incoming connections because it uses [long polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling);
- It is worth turning on [privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) in the settings of the bot.

    
# Building from sources
You can look up [our github actions](/.github/workflows) for the required platform and perform the necessary steps yourself, or you can download the [GitHub Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) (self-hosted) and run one of the required workflows.    
    
# Dhaf as a service, automatically started at OS startup
This is done e.g. via [Systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) on Linux. For Windows you can use [Windows service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service).
The templates can be found in the `templates` folder of the current repository.

# Some tips for dhaf cooking
- Do not host dhaf cluster nodes on the same servers as your web service;
- It is possible (and logical) to place the etcd nodes in the same place as dhaf;
- Number of nodes etcd should not be less than three (then it is possible to survive the fall of one of the nodes). Read more [here](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/faq/#what-is-failure-tolerance);
- The number of dhaf nodes should be at least two, but considering that they usually work in the same place as etcd, it is logical to make them three as well. However, even with a two-node cluster, dhaf can survive a failure of one of the nodes;
- For a dhaf cluster node (even in combination with etcd) the cheapest virtual server (including cloud servers) is enough, because the load on it is minimal due to the fact that it is not engaged in serving a bunch of users - it deals with the health of your web service;
- Locate dhaf cluster nodes (and etcd) at different providers in different data centers. This prevents you from having to deal with the unpleasant situation where one of the providers has its entire infrastructure down. Also, nodes should be geographically located where you expect to use your service (i.e. in terms of the network "bring" nodes closer to real users);
- The entry points for the web service in the dhaf configuration should be at least two, but perhaps this is obvious;
- If you have a desire and/or need to load balance, that is not what dhaf is for. Its purpose is to provide a working entry point into a web service, and it is by no means a (reverse) proxy server. So, if there is a need for the above, then the entry points in the dhaf configuration should be servers with e.g. [HAProxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAProxy) (or its equivalent), whose functionality is designed to do just that.

# How to write your own dhaf provider in .NET
Want to write your own provider (switcher or health checker) for **dhaf**? It's very easy to do. Out of the box in the dhaf core, such things as logging, distributed storage access (extension area only), configurations (internal and for users) and so on are available for extension development.
    
Minimal templates (skeletons) for each provider type can be seen [here](/templates/dhaf_extensions). If you think your extension turned out wonderful, you can create a [PR](https://github.com/hyperion-cs/dhaf/pulls) to add it to the core extensions.
    
All **dhaf** extensions have one required dependency ‚Äî `Dhaf.Core`. For ease of development, this can be obtained directly from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dhaf.Core/). Keep in mind, however, that this dependency should not be packed into your extension when publishing, since it is already present in `Dhaf.Node` (this is the dhaf component that uses your extensions). The same applies to the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions`. So they both have to be added with the `PrivateAssets="All"` parameter to your **.csproj** extension:
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Dhaf.Core" Version="<VERSION_HERE>"  PrivateAssets="All"/>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions" Version="<VERSION_HERE>" PrivateAssets="All" />
```
You can run (e.g., to manually test the extension) directly using `Dhaf.Node`. You can also set up automatic copying (for development purposes only) of your extension for `Dhaf.Node` into **.csproj**:
```xml
<Target Name="CopyExtension" Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'" AfterTargets="AfterBuild">
    <Copy SourceFiles="$(OutDir)\<YOUR_EXT_BIN_NAME>.dll;$(OutDir)\extension.json"
          DestinationFolder="$(SolutionDir)\<PATH_TO_DHAF_NODE>\extensions\<YOUR_EXT_TYPE>\<YOUR_EXT_NAME>" />
</Target>
```
    
# Terminology
- Failover ‚Äî emergency switching of the entry point in automatic mode;
- Switchover ‚Äî knowingly manually switching entry points (for maintenance, testing, etc.);
- Switching ‚Äî automatically switching of the entry point to the higher priority of the healthy ones.
